Following are the answers for the DBMS query questions:

1.select *
from employee

2.select ssn,lname,fname,address
from employee
where dno=5

8.select fname,salary
from employee
where dno=5 and salary between 20000 and 40000

9.select fname,superssn
from employee
where superssn is NULL

10.select ssn,dname
from employee,department
where dno=dnumber

11.select fname,address
from employee,department
where dnumber=dno and dname='Research'

12.select pnumber,dnum,fname as Manager,address,bdate

and (mgrssn=ssn or essn=ssn) and lname='Narayan'

16.1.update employee
set salary=salary*1.15
where dno in(select dnum
             from project,works_on
             where pno=pnumber and pname='ProductX')

16.2.select fname||' '||minit||'. '||lname as Name,salary
from employee

17.select fname,dnum,pname
from department,employee,project,works_on
where pnumber=pno and essn=ssn and dnumber=dno
order by dnum,fname

18.select fname
from employee
where salary not in(select salary
                    from employee
                    where dno=4)

19.select fname||' '||minit||'. '||lname as Name,dependent_name as Dependent
from employee e,dependent d
where e.ssn=d.essn and d.dependent_name like '%'||fname||'%' and e.sex=d.sex

20.select distinct essn,plocation
from project,works_on
where pno=pnumber and plocation in('Bellaire','Houston','Stafford')

21.select sum(salary) as "Total Salary",max(salary) as "Maximum Salary",
min(salary) as "Minimum Salary",avg(salary) as "Average Salary"
from employee

22.select sum(salary) as "Total Salary",count (*) as "No. of employees",
max(salary) as "Maximum Salary",min(salary) as "Minimum Salary",avg(salary) as "Average Salary"
from employee,department
where dno=dnumber and dname='Research'

23.select fname||' '||minit||'. '||lname as Name
from employee
where salary>(select avg(salary) 
	      from employee 
	      where dno=5)

24.select dno as Dep_Num,count(dno)as "No of Employees",avg(salary) as "Average Salary"
from employee
group by dno

25.select pnumber,pname,count(pnumber)as "No. of Employees"
from project,works_on
where pnumber = pno
group by pnumber,pname

26.update project
set plocation='Bellaire',dnum=4
where pnumber in(select pno
		 from works_on
		 group by pno
		 having count(pno)>2)

27.select dno as "Department Number",count(dno)as "No. of Employees"
from employee
where salary>20000
group by dno
having count(dno)>3

28.1.insert into project
values ('ProjectW',4,'Sugarland',3)

28.2.insert into department
values ('Marketing',3,123456789,'30/Oct/97')

29.delete from dependent
where essn=123456789

30.First run the given four foreign key integrity constraint commands:

alter table employee
add constraint fk_superssn
foreign key(superssn)
references employee(ssn)
on delete set NULL

alter table department
add constraint fk_mgrssn
foreign key(mgrssn)
references employee(ssn)
on delete set NULL

alter table works_on
add constraint fk_essn
foreign key(essn)
references employee(ssn)
on delete cascade

alter table dependent
add constraint fk_dep_essn
foreign key(essn)
references employee(ssn)
on delete cascade

Now run this:

delete from employee
where ssn=333445555

31.1.alter table employee
add (SNo int unique)

31.2.alter table employee
drop column SNo
